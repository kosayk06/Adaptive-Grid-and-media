# Adaptive Grid and Media

Responsive one-page layout with a hero block, burger navigation, and a tile grid for consulting services. Built as a clean HTML/CSS page that scales down nicely on mobile.

## Live demo
- GitHub Pages: https://kosayk06.github.io/Adaptive-Grid-and-media/

## Highlights
- Hero section with headline and supporting text.
- Burger nav on small screens that locks body scroll when open.
- Six background-image tiles that reflow via media queries.
- Plain stack: semantic HTML, modern CSS, and a lightweight JS hook if you need behavior.

## Tech stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (media queries for responsiveness)
- JavaScript (src/js/script.js)
